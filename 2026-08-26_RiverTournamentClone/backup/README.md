## 🚨 Emergency Restoration Instructions

### Quick Restore (Git Method)

If the website breaks and you need to quickly restore to this working state:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/RiverTournament

# Create a backup branch of current state (optional but recommended)
git checkout -b emergency-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git add -A
git commit -m "Emergency backup before restoration"

# Return to main branch and restore to working commit
git checkout main
git reset --hard 766d7c6

# Rebuild the site
bundle exec jekyll build

# If you want to push the restoration (BE CAREFUL - this overwrites history)
# git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### File-by-File Restoration

If you need to restore specific files only, use the backup files in this directory:

```bash
# Copy specific files from backup
cp backup/[filename] ./[filename]

# Rebuild Jekyll site
bundle exec jekyll build
```

## 🔧 Critical Files for Styling

These files are essential for proper website appearance:

### `/assets/scss/_variables.scss`

**CRITICAL:** Contains color variable definitions. Must include:

```scss
--off-white: #f5f5f5;
--cool-link: #d4af37;
--cool-link-hover: #a47f00;
```

### `/assets/scss/_components.scss`

Contains button styles, layout components, and general styling rules.

### `/assets/scss/_rules.scss`

Contains tournament rules page specific styling.

### `/faq.html`

FAQ page with proper formatting and structure.

## 🏗️ Rebuild Process

After any file restoration:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
bundle install

# Build the site
bundle exec jekyll build

# Serve locally for testing (optional)
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Dark text instead of off-white

**Cause:** Missing CSS color variables  
**Solution:** Restore `_variables.scss` and ensure these variables exist:

- `--off-white: #f5f5f5;`
- `--cool-link: #d4af37;`
- `--cool-link-hover: #a47f00;`

### Issue: Jekyll build fails

**Cause:** Missing dependencies or corrupted files  
**Solution:**

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll clean
bundle exec jekyll build
```

### Issue: Styling completely broken

**Cause:** Corrupted SCSS files  
**Solution:** Restore all files from this backup directory
